<p>
<b> Welcome to ScalaTion, the Scala-based system for Simulation, Optimization and Analytics. </b>

<p>
This system, coded in Scala, supports multi-paradigm simulation modeling including
'tableau', 'event', 'process', 'dynamics', 'dynamics_pde', 'activity' and 'state' oriented models.

<p>
<a href = "http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> is a modern object-oriented, functional programming language
that is well-suited for developing simulation engines.
It is in the Java family of languages and can call Java code.
The inclusion of advanced and functional programming capabilities,
makes the code much more concise than Java.
ScalaTion also supports optimization and analytics as they nowadays go hand-in-hand with simulation modeling.
Some of the algorithms come in both sequential and parallel versions.

<p>
The <b>ScalaTion 1.6</b> version defines multiple .par subpackages that contain parallel versions of sequential algorithms.
Future directions include completing the 'scala3d' and 'physics' packages.

<p>
As of version 1.6, ScalaTion consists of five subprojects:
scalation_mathematics, scalation_statistics, scalation_database, scalation_modeling and scalation_models

<p>
Please read the <a href = LICENSE.html> LICENSE </a> file (an MIT style license).

<h3> Installation Instructions </h3>

Requires:
<a href = "http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads">Scala 2.12.8+</a> and
<a href = "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads">Java 8</a>
<br>
Recommended:
<a href = "http://www.scala-sbt.org/">sbt</a> &nbsp;
(see <a href = "http://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html">Setup.html</a>)
<br>
Getting started: <a href = "https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Hello.html">sbt Hello, World</a>

<h4>1. Download one of the following two files</h4>

<a href = "../scalation_1.6.tar.gz"> scalation_1.6.tar.gz </a> <br> <b>OR</b> <br>
<a href = "../scalation_1.6.zip"> scalation_1.6.zip </a>

<p>
<h4>2. Untar or unzip the file</h4>

<pre><code>
$ tar xvfz scalation_1.6.tar.gz <br> <b>OR</b> <br>
$ unzip scalation_1.6.zip
</code></pre>


<h4>3. To build all the modules, change into the ScalaTion base directory and run the build_all.sh shell script</h4>

<pre><code>
$ cd scalation_1.6 <br>
$ ./build_all.sh <br>
</code></pre>

<h4>4. To compile code or run apps, change into one of the module directories, enter sbt and type compile, runMain or exit </h4>

<pre><code>
$ cd scalation_modeling <br>
$ sbt <br>
> compile <br>
> runMain scalation.analytics.SimpleRegressionTest <br>
> runMain scalation.analytics.RegressionTest <br>
> runMain scalation.analytics.PredictorMatTest <br>
> exit
</code></pre>

<p>
The compile command is optional, since runMain will automatically compile if need be.

<p>
ScalaTion is set up to use the Simple Build Tool <a href = "http://www.scala-sbt.org">sbt</a>.
ScalaTion 1.6 uses the following five build specification files (one for each module):

<ol>
<li>
scalation_mathematics: <a href = "scalation_mathematics/build.sbt">build.sbt</a>,
<li>
scalation_statistics: <a href = "scalation_statistics/build.sbt">build.sbt</a>,
<li>
scalation_database: <a href = "scalation_database/build.sbt">build.sbt</a>,
<li>
scalation_modeling: <a href = "scalation_modeling/build.sbt">build.sbt</a> and
<li>
scalation_models: <a href = "scalation_models/build.sbt">build.sbt</a>.
</ol>

Source packages are in the <b>src/main/scala</b> directory,
class files are in the <b>target/scala-2.12/classes</b> directory, and
documentation files are in the <b>target/scala-2.12/api</b> directory.
Unmanaged jar files are stored in a common library <b>../lib</b> directory, <a href = "lib">lib</a>.
Data file input, output or analytics are stored in subdirectories of <b>data</b>,
while database files are stored in <b>store</b>.

<h4>5.  To develop projects that use ScalaTion that are outside ScalaTion do the following </h4>

<pre><code>
$ cd your_project_dir <br>
$ sbt new sbt/scala-seed.g8 <br>
$ cd hello <br>
$ mkdir lib <br>
copy jar files from <a href = "lib">lib</a> <br>
$ cd src/main/scala/example <br>
$ vim Hello.scala <br>
</code></pre>

The second time you do this, you will want to use a more appropriate name than hello.
