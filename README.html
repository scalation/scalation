<p>
<b> Welcome to ScalaTion, the Scala-based system for Simulation, Optimization and Analytics. </b>

<p>
This system, coded in Scala, supports multi-paradigm simulation modeling including
'tableau', 'event', 'process', 'dynamics', 'dynamics_pde', 'activity' and 'state' oriented models.

<p>
<a href = "http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> is a modern object-oriented, functional programming language
that is well-suited for developing simulation engines.
It is in the Java family of languages and can call Java code.
The inclusion of advanced and functional programming capabilities,
makes the code much more concise than Java.
ScalaTion also supports optimization and analytics as they nowadays go hand-in-hand with simulation modeling.
Some of the algorithms come in both sequential and parallel versions.

<p>
The <b>ScalaTion 1.5</b> version defines multiple .par subpackages that contain parallel versions of sequential algorithms.
Future directions include completing the 'scala3d' and 'physics' packages.

<p>
As of version 1.5, ScalaTion consists of 4 subprojects:
scalation_mathstat, scalation_database, scalation_modeling and scalation_models

<p>
Please read the <a href = LICENSE.html> LICENSE </a> file (an MIT style license).

Similarly for scalation_modeling and scalation_models.
Currently the .jar files need to be copied (copy_jars.sh) into the lib directory of dependent subprojects.
