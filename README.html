<p>
<b> Welcome to ScalaTion, the Scala-based system for Simulation, Optimization and Analytics. </b>

<p>
This system, coded in Scala, supports multi-paradigm simulation modeling including
'tableau', 'event', 'process', 'dynamics', 'dynamics_pde', 'activity' and 'state' oriented models.

<p>
<a href = "http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> is a modern object-oriented, functional programming language
<!-- (see <a href = "feature_matrix.html"> feature matrix </a>) -->
that is well-suited for developing simulation engines.
It is in the Java family of languages and can call Java code.
The inclusion of advanced and functional programming capabilities,
makes the code much more concise than Java.
ScalaTion also supports optimization and analytics as they nowadays go hand-in-hand with simulation modeling.
Some of the algorithms come in both sequential and parallel versions.

<p>
The <b>ScalaTion 1.2</b> version defines multiple .par subpackages that contain parallel versions of sequential algorithms.
Future directions include completing the 'scala3d' and 'physics' packages.

<p>
Please read the <a href = LICENSE.html> LICENSE </a> file (an MIT style license).

<h3> Installation Instructions </h3>

Requires:
<a href = "http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads">Scala 2.12.x</a> and
<a href = "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads">Java 8</a>
<br>
Recommended:
<a href = "http://www.scala-sbt.org/">sbt</a> &nbsp;
(see <a href = "http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Setup.html">Setup.html</a>)

<h4>1. Download one of the following two files</h4>

<a href = "../scalation_1.2.tar.gz"> scalation_1.2.tar.gz </a> <br> <b>OR</b> <br>

<p>
<h4>2. Untar or unzip the file</h4>

<pre><code>
$ tar xvfz scalation_1.2.tar.gz <br> <b>OR</b> <br>
$ unzip scalation_1.2.zip
</code></pre>

<!--
<p>
<h4>3. Export the SCALATION_CLASSES environment variable to point at class files</h4>

<pre><code>
export SCALATION_CLASSES=$HOME/scalation_1.2/target/scala-2.12.0-M2/classes
</code></pre>

<p>
Adjust the prefix to correspond to where you installed scalation.
Ideally, put the export in one of your dot files (e.g., .profile or .bashrc).
-->

<h4>3. To compile code or run apps, enter sbt and type compile, run-main or exit </h4>

<pre><code>
$ cd scalation_1.2 <br>

ScalaTion 1.2 is set up to use the Simple Build Tool <a href = "http://www.scala-sbt.org">sbt</a>.

<p>
ScalaTion 1.2 uses the following build specification file
<a href = "build.sbt">build.sbt</a>.
Source packages are in the <b>src/main/scala</b> directory,
class files are in the <b>target/scala-2.12.0-M2/classes</b> directory, and
documentation files are in the <b>target/scala-2.12.0-M2/api</b> directory.
Data file input, output or analytics are stored in subdirectories of <b>data</b>,

<pre><code>
$ scar apps.process.Bank <br> <b>OR</b> <br>
$ scala -cp $SCALATION_CLASSES apps.process.Bank
</code></pre>

<p>

The '<a href = "scar">scar</a>' shell script works for Linux, Unix and Mac.
Use '<a href = "scar.bat">scar.bat</a>' for Windows.
</code></pre>

<h4>5. Run src test code (e.g., for Regression in scalation.analytics)</h4>

<pre><code>
$ scar scalation.analytics.RegressionTest <br> <b>OR</b> <br>
$ scala -cp $SCALATION_CLASSES scalation.analytics.RegressionTest
</code></pre>
