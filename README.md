<h1> SCALAble SimulaTION - ScalaTion </h1>
</center>

<p>
<b> Welcome to ScalaTion, the Scala-based system for Simulation, Optimization and Analytics. </b>

<p>
This system, coded in Scala, supports multi-paradigm simulation modeling including
'tableau', 'event', 'process', 'dynamics', 'dynamics_pde', 'activity' and 'state' oriented models.

<p>
<a href = "http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> is a modern object-oriented, functional programming language
that is well-suited for developing simulation engines.
It is in the Java family of languages and can call Java code.
The inclusion of advanced and functional programming capabilities,
makes the code much more concise than Java.
ScalaTion also supports optimization and analytics as they nowadays go hand-in-hand with simulation modeling.
Some of the algorithms come in both sequential and parallel versions.

<p>
Please visit the <a href = "http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~jam/scalation.html">ScalaTion Homepage</a> for installation instructions and documentations.
